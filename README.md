# Employee Tracker

## Description
This program interacts with a SQL database, creates a tables on first-run, and allows someone to track all of the employees, roles, and their departments. This would allow for easier tracking, establishing relationships across several tables and relationships between two different keys. I learned how to utilize Sequelize to interact with the tables, run queries through JavaScript, and runs through Node.js.

## Installation
This requires installation of Node.js for it to run. Please run 'npm start' to install all required packages. It also requires a .env file to establish the SQL host, its username, and its password.

## Usage
Here is an example of the program running:
